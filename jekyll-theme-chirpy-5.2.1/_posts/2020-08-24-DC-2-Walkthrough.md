DC-2 is an easy machine. This machine starts with a `WordPress site`. After brute-forcing, We find out creds on the website that we use to get an `ssh session` on the box. Priv esc to root by exploiting `git SUID binary`.

Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.10
Host is up (0.00047s latency).

```

Nmap scan show that port 80 and 7744 are open

```
Port 80: On this port, I find out a Domain name. I added to /etc/hosts file and surf the page. I discovered that WordPress is installed.

Port 7744: They are running SSH on this port. So I don't have any credentials so I moved forward.
```
# Initial Shell:

## Flag 1:
I got the first flag on the Main page
![flag1](/assets/img/dc-2/flag1.png)



As per hint in the first flag, I created a password list using cewl.

```bash
cewl -w password.txt http://dc-2
```

After that, I use wpscan to identify possible users and I found 3 users.

![wpscan](/assets/img/dc-2/wpscan.png)

Users :-
- admin
- jerry
- tom

Now I have a password and user list so I brute force the wordpress.
Here I use wfuzz to brute force.

```bash
wfuzz -c --hc=200 -z file,users.txt -z file,password.txt -d 'log=FUZZ&pwd=FUZ2Z&wp-submit=Log+In' http://dc-2/wp-login.php
```

![wfuzz](/assets/img/dc-2/wfuzz.png)

Here I got 2 passwords.
- ```jerry:adipiscing```
- ```tom:parturient```

## Flag 2:
I use jerry password to access wordpress panel and got second flag.

![flag2](/assets/img/dc-2/flag2.png)

## First User:
I spend some time to upload php reverse shell, but no luck :(
Then I tried same creds to access SSH on port 7744.
``` $ ssh tom@dc-2 -p 7744```

## Updating shell:

I tried to cat the flag3.txt but no luck. We are in a restricted shell. I checked usr/bin directory and PATH variable I noticed that tom is using binaries from that directory.
Here I learned new things about how to launch a shell using vi.

Steps:

1. Open VI editor 
2. Press ESC + :
3. set shell=/bin/bash
4. Again step 1 and 2 
5. shell

So I have shell using VI.

Now I am out of restricted shell but still using commands in usr/bin directory. I need to change PATH variable.

```export PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH```

## Flag 3:
Now I am able to cat the third flag.

![flag 3](/assets/img/dc-2/flag3.png)

## Second User:
Flag gives hint we need to switch user i.e jerry.

>jerry:adipiscing

![user2](/assets/img/dc-2/user2.png)

# Privesc to root:

Now I checked the sudoers list and found that I can run git without password.
![sudoer](/assets/img/dc-2/sudoer.png)

After some googling I found a [link](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/git/#shell).
